Version 1.0

The goal is to build a completely functional website that has all standard functionalities for an e-commerce type
website.
I am a Java Noob so please be gentle.
I get a lot of ideas from Youtube video tutorials and the available web documentation as well as dedicated forums.

This project was created with Spring Boot, fully coded in IntelliJ and connected to a SQL Server database.
For now, I am just doing tests with the current functionalities, but I am eager to implement more functionalities for
the future.
If you have any suggestions please feel free to share them. I really appreciate any help I can get.
